                    <p>
                        I have just finished my A-levels at Aston Academy's Sixth form and I enjoy coding and am willing to learn new things in my free time whilst working hard and being organised. I possess good team working skills with enthusiasm and an eagerness to learn and gain experience. I'm very keen to pursue a career in a software development/software engineer role so this is the perfect opportunity for me.
